Hi! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a full-stack software engineer who's passionate about solving problems and is always looking for an interesting challenge!

------

Most recently, I spent 2021 shipping Ranger, a no-code solution for businesses to centralize and leverage their Excel data. 

As the sole front-end engineer on a team of two, I was responsible for designing, architecting and implementing a robust production- and business-use-ready web app. It's currently available in the Microsoft App Source store, having met Microsoft's rigorous privacy, accessibility and QA guidelines. You can find out a little more about it at [getranger.co](https://www.getranger.co). 

-------

Before that, I spent the last few years building fast, functional custom web apps for small to medium businesses. I started with a background in marketing before doing a coding boot camp because I felt like my clients' websites were lacking and I wanted to build better ones. My ambitions have grown and while I love helping small businesses with their problems, these days I like solving problems on a bigger scale and I'm looking for my next opportunity.

------

I have a lot of production-level work in private repos, but you can get a feel for some of the tools I like to use in the public repos below. (And if you're a Vim user, check out my plugin!)

*Some technology that I love working with, in no particular order:*

TypeScript (although I'm a relatively recent convert), React, Gatsby, NextJS, Git, Webpack, Github Actions, styled-components, CSS variables

*Some hot button developer topics that I'm excited about:*

CI/CD and developer tooling, accessibility, monorepos, serverless functions (although I'm also excited about the shift back toward server-rendering), CSS Houdini

*Some tech that I'm itching to have an excuse to try out and learn more about:*

Svelte, Turborepo, Web Assembly

I'd love to talk if you think there's an opportunity for us to work together! I'm also a firm believer that **everything** is interesting. If you're truly passionate about something (anything!) I'd probably love to hear about it.

Don't be shy!

You can reach me at my first and last name at gmail dot com.
